# Week1 - Basic Java Review

## 1. Static Vs Non-Static
* Static(class): actions that are taken by the class itself  
* Non-Static(instance): actions that can be taken only by a specific instance of a class, not associated with any particular instance.

## 2. public static void main(String[] args)
* args: main is called by the Java interpreter itself, it is the interpreter's job to supply these arguments. They refer usually to the command line arguments.
