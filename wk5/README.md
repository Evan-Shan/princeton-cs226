## Simplified Analysis Process
1. choose a 'representative operation(cost function)';
2. figure out the order of growth for the count of cost function;

## Big Theta Notation
* Definition: Big–Theta(Θ) specifies asymptotic bounds (both upper and lower) for a function R(N). We say R(N) = N^2 + 2N belongs to the big theta(N^2);

## Big O Notation
* Definition: The Big-O Asymptotic Notation gives us the Upper Bound Idea, which is less than or equal to; We can say R(N) = N^2 + 2N < big O(N^3);
